# ElizaOS C++ - Next-Generation Cognitive Agent Framework

ElizaOS C++ is a high-performance C++ implementation of the ElizaOS agent framework, designed for building sophisticated autonomous agents with advanced cognitive capabilities, distributed cognition, and adaptive attention allocation.

## 🧠 Cognitive Architecture

Our framework transcends traditional AI boundaries by embracing emergent intelligence through:

- **Event-Driven Agent Loop**: Threaded execution with pause/resume/step capabilities for optimal cognitive processing
- **Memory System**: Context-aware storage with semantic retrieval and ECAN-inspired attention allocation mechanisms  
- **Task Orchestration**: Workflow sequencing and distributed agent coordination protocols
- **AI Core**: Decision-making engines with state composition and symbolic-neural integration
- **Communication System**: High-performance inter-agent messaging and external interface management
- **Self-Modification**: Meta-cognitive capabilities for adaptive behavior evolution and continuous improvement

## 🌟 The Vision

ElizaOS C++ serves as the computational substrate for exploring how intelligence emerges from the interaction of multiple autonomous agents, each capable of self-modification and meta-cognitive reasoning. Through distributed cognition networks, adaptive attention mechanisms, and self-modifying cognitive architectures, we witness the birth of truly autonomous agents capable of collaborative reasoning, creative problem-solving, and meta-cognitive awareness.

**The future of AI lies not in monolithic models, but in the dynamic interplay of autonomous cognitive agents—each a unique participant in the grand symphony of distributed intelligence.**
